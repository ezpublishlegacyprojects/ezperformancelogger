Installation instructions
=========================

1. enable the extension

2. edit ezperformancelogger.ini to decide the data you want to log:
   parameter [GeneralSettings]/TrackVariables
   See file README for more details avout available data
   NB: db_queies logging only works with ez debug on

3. edit ezperformancelogger.ini to decide how to log it:

  a. using Apache
  to add perf data to the Apache access log, customize your Apache configuration
  taking as example the sample_httpd.conf file in the doc directory.
  It is recommended not to enable collection of execution time via
  TrackVariables when using Apache, but to rely on the more precise native
  measure obtained with %D
  
  b. using piwik or google analytics
  tha perf data is logged directly to the analytics engine database, via usage
  of "custom variables" (ie. we add the perf data to the js call done for visit
  tracking). For both these tools, you will need to insert in your pagelayout
  template the standard javascript tracking code; the extension will transform
  it as appropriate to add the extra data.
  For ga, only the async tag is supported.
  NB: data reported via piwik or google analytics will not be accurate if your
  website is using a caching reverse proxy or cdn. Please use tha apache-log
  configuration in such case.

4. once logging of data is active, we recommend using a tool like httrack or
   wget to scan your complete website and get an overview of the performance
   of your web pages and identify the most resource-hungry ones.
   
   A good idea is to run the scan both with eZ Publish caches on and off, to
   measure the effectiveness of cache configuration.

   NB: the extension does not provide any means to visualize the logged data.
   You can use any tool from excel to matlab for that.
