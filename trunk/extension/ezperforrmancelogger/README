An extension dedicated to measuring performances of eZ Publish websites
=======================================================================

How it works:

- by logging performance indicators for every page view
  Supported indicators are, so far:
  . total execution time
  . total memory usage
  . number of db queries

- the logging of the data can be directed to different media:
  . the Apache access log
  . the piwik web analytics engine
  . the google analytics engine
  and in the future even more

Currently the extension does not provide a way to graph or visualize the logged
data, you will need an external tool for that:
. for data streamed to the Apache log, a parser such as awstats, duly customized
. for data streamed to piwik or ga, use the analytics tool web interface

Notes about collected data:
- measured script runtime is a bit shorter than reality, as we can not hook at the very end of eZP page generation process
- measured time is rounded to milliseconds
- measured ram usage is rounded to 1000 bytes
- db queries executed can only (most likely?) be measured when debugging is turned on
